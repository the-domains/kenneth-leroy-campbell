Have you ever wanted to scream about all the stupidity you see about you? One way to avoid this situation is to avoid all news and social media sources. But sometimes you are tempted and so here you are.

Sometimes I want to crawl back into the cave and say "Good try, humanity. Better luck next time." For every step forward there is always a big jog back in barbarity.  I suppose all we can do is to contribute the little we can to progress and hope our children all survive to face a better future.
