Have you ever wanted to scream about all the stupidity you see about you? One way to avoid this situation is to avoid all news and social media sources. But sometimes you are tempted and so here you are.

Sometimes I want to crawl back into the cave and say "Good try, humanity. Better luck next time." For every step forward there is always a big jog back in barbarity.  I suppose all we can do is to contribute the little we can to progress and hope our children all survive to face a better future.

**In Luc Bresson's film [The Fifth Element][0] there is a scene where the reconstituted Supreme Being (She's been asleep for thousands of years and only a scrap of Her survived total destruction) is reviewing human history on a computer screen. When she comes across the visuals of the 20th century and all the wars and holocausts  mankind has been involved in, She is aghast! She laments that there is no reason to make any effort to save mankind from the impending doom heading towards Earth if this is what mankind has devolved into. Only the efforts of Bruce Willis's character convinces her that there _is_ one reason to save us all --  love. If love did not exist, then all would have been lost. Love saves the day (and the human race).**

**"I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word." _-Martin Luther King, Jr._**
