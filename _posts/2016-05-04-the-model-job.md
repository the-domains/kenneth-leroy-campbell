The Model Job

Part 1

****

Charisse's rent was due. It was only a single room apartment. She had a top unit of the converted shipping container stack in Elysium Fields Estates. Being on the sixth floor of the walkup block, she had the lowest rent. Fifty units per floor with the breezeway between the units, twenty-five per side. The south end of her unit contained a large window, the other end the bathroom/kitchen/ exterior door. The view wasn't much but she got some of the unfiltered sunlight shining through in the afternoon on her work table where she kept her Pad.

She left it out so the sun could charge its battery. Saved a kilowatt hour each month. The window doubled as her video screen when the window was off. The sunlight charged its battery also. Her Pad was her lifeline to the outside world. She also charged up her wireless keypad in the sunlight. Her auxiliary keypad wasn't absolutely necessary but she had grown up with it. Speak & Spell It was OK, but she thought better with her fingers. But the Pad had reminded her about her rent, both visually and aurally, twice now.

****

She checked her money account. A few dollars. Even fewer cents. Rats! The last thing she needed was to be homeless again. Years ago she never seemed to have to worry about money. She made a good living writing short stories and poems. She had even sold a novel. The future had looked bright. Then the A.I. revolution reared its ugly head. People all over lost their careers when robotics took over. She was sure her career was secure. Ok, robots could do all the menial repetitive tasks, take over the dangerous jobs, even work twenty-four hours a day without bathroom breaks. The poor working man (and woman) was out of luck. Even fast food joints got along fine without human labor. Eighty percent of the workforce was out of a job. But only a beautiful mind could write a good story. WRONG!

****

Robo-writers with the Asimov algorithm were now all the rage, writing stories and books custom fit to the mass market reader, leaving the human element to shrivel up and die. Literature was a dying art. Like classical music and painting. So what if the few remaining human critics panned the robowriters' product as "slag heaps of mediocrity." As soon as the robo-writers replaced the critics and began writing the reviews, the market for her type of creative writing would be completely dead.

****

Congress passed a robotics restitution bill, supposedly insuring the replaced worker a living stipend, getting a cut of what the roboworker earned its owner. The redundant worker could relax and take it easy, letting the robots do all the work. But like anything Congress did, it flopped. You couldn't live on Social Security in your old age, and you sure couldn't live on Robo Security before you reached the magic age of seventy. Everyone had to scramble, trying to find the niches that robots couldn't invade. The service industry flourished, and anyone who had money could hire real people to do their bidding. The real winners were the lucky people who managed to own their personal working Bot. All profits went to them, less the government's cut, of course.

****

Online, she began her search. Ninety-nine percent of all the listings looked like scams. She looked around her room for something she could sell. Her modest library of real paper books was long gone. All that was left was the King James Bible her father had given her. Tissue thin paper, old fashioned prose, real cowhide cover. It was a family keepsake and wouldn't bring much. Better to keep it. Her father had hoped it would keep her on the straight and narrow. Hadn't worked. She hadn't killed anyone but many or the other ten commandments had gotten broken or bent here and there. Gluttony. Sloth. A few others. But she was older and wiser now and all of that was behind her with her misplaced and misspent youth.

****

Well, perhaps painting is not dead afterall, she thought. Here is a job for an artist's model.

Some nudity required. Inquire at this address. 

There was no email, no other link, just a street address but no apartment number. She did a search and the map showed a lonely house on a street without any other houses. It was in the reclaimed area of the city. As the urban population declined, areas of the city suffered urban blight. As houses were abandoned, the authorities cleared the site and planted trees. Here and there a few stubborn holdouts kept their premises in good repair and refused to sell to the city. So like this house they sat alone, surrounded by open land slowly turning into an urban forest or actual farms. A freehold in a urban megalopolis.

****

She thought about writing a physical letter of inquiry but she had no stationary. The postage would have cost as much as a meal at her favorite quick food eatery. Best just to go there and knock on the door. She made preparations for her trip. She made sure her friends knew where she would be in case she disappeared. The city was still a dangerous place after dark, and she didn't know how safe the area she had to go to would be. She had recently viewed a live revival of Sondheim's 

Into the Woods

and decided to wear her red cape, the one she had gotten for her Halloween costume party last year. Might as well go into the woods stylishly. It would match her red Copenhagen-wheeled electric bicycle.

****

She set off on her bike, following the directions on her Phone. It would be a sixty minute ride, half of it on the dedicated bike path through the city, the rest on little used roads, some in need of major repair. It was early afternoon, the weather was cool and pleasant. Truck and auto traffic noise on the overhead thruways was muffled by the greenery and sound dampening system. Only a few other bikers were on the four lane bikeway. In another hour it would be crowded with rush hour commuters and school kids making their way home. She was enjoying the ride. Her twenty year old Copenhagen wheel added just the right amount of boost to her pedaling to keep any strenuous effort at bay, and the cool air took away any sweat she might be producing from her pedalling efforts as she climbed the occasional hill.

****

An hour later she arrived. She'd been chased by a dog a few blocks back but she had ignored it, kept up a steady pace, and it gave up the chase. She had seen a rabbit lifted up and carried away by a hawk as it hopped across the street, empty of traffic. The lack of cover made it an easy target. She recalled a story her grandfather had once told her. He had something called a paper route, where he physically delivered daily news printed on large sheets of paper to people's front porches. He was coasting down a street early one morning on his bicycle when from out of nowhere a large black crow screeched at him as it dive bombed his head from behind and took off with his cap. He had nearly collided with a power pole as he tried to get over the shock of being attacked so suddenly. She could imagine what the rabbit had felt as the hawk's talons gripped its back and yanked it off the ground. The rest she didn't want to imagine. She was not a superstitious person but if she had believed in omens. . . .

****

She arrived at the house, a two story bungalow set back from the street. An old fashioned mailbox on a wooden post stood by the street. It's red flag was up. He must still have postal delivery service. A one-car detached garage sat back aways from the house. A white picket fence in good repair encircled the yard. The yard itself was a little overgrown but had a cleared pathway open to the front porch. Opening the gate, she walked her bike in and up the steps to the door and looked for a doorbell or intercom. She saw no sign of a security camera. There was a thick string hanging from a hole in the door frame at eye level with a red rubber ball at the end. She pulled gently a couple of times and waited. She thought she heard a faint bell ringing somewhere inside the house. She thought she heard a piano in the distance. Then all was quiet.

****

Parking her bike next to the porch railing and removing her Phone from its holder, she took a look around. Two large trees shaded the roof. Curtains drawn across the windows blocked her view inside. The house might as well have been sitting in a park. All around her were trees and bushes and the empty street. She saw a slight movement of the curtain. Someone was looking her over. She glanced at her Phone. No signal. That was odd.

****

She heard the clunk-clunk-clunk of three electronic deadbolts opening, then the door opened a crack. A wizened eye appeared and a faint old voice said, "What do you want."

****

"I'm answering your ad for a model. Is this the right house?"

****

After a slight pause the voice said, "Look around, do you see many other houses?" He looked at her with a glint in his eye. "Are you alone?"

****

"It's just me." An awkward silence followed. "My name is Charisse."

****

"Come in, young lady." The door opened soundlessly and closed behind her with a soft clunk-clunk-clunk as the bolts slid into place.

****

Going from the bright sunlit outside to the dark interior, it took a couple of moments to adjust before she could clearly see where she was. The entryway was lined with bookshelves filled with real books, hundreds of them. And not paperbacks either. Honest-to-God hardbacked books. They must be worth a fortune. He said, "This way," and moved off slowly. The first room they went through had some furniture and more books. A small grand piano sat in the middle of the room. One wall had hundreds of large phonograph records, their slim spines lined up and standing vertical between the shelf supports. In the corner sat an antique Edison cylinder phonograph in a mahogany cabinet with its ornate acoustic horn rising from its player mechanism. A cold fireplace, dark and empty, filled out the room.

****

"Were you playing the piano?"

****

"No, that was my wife," he said quietly.

****

The next room was filled with light. The north wall was mostly glass, and plants in pots filled several tables placed around the window. A grey cat lay among some colorful orchids. The cat seemed asleep and did not move. The next room was a kitchen with a small table with two chairs. The table was round and had a clean table cloth and nothing else on it. The gas stove looked old but clean and well maintained. A drying rack sat next to the sink and it contained a white plate, a clear drinking glass, a stained coffee cup and some metal forks and spoons and knives. On the wall was a collection of kitchen knives held up by a magnetic strip. A much used antique cutting board lay on the counter. An meandering ivy plant covered the top of the tall two door metallic refrigerator. It was the only thing which looked new in the kitchen.

****

The next room was a den, with easy chair, couch, a medium sized wall screen and some tall speakers. Next to them was a well used electronic amplifier with glass tubes dimly glowing, an ancient Lp turntable and a modern multi-disk player. A book lay turned upside down on the table next to the easy chair. A reading lamp snaked from a stand next to the chair. The cracked leather chair looked worn and well used.

****

"Sit down, please." He pointed to the couch.

****

Charisse sat and put her hands on her lap and crossed her legs at her ankles.

****

Suddenly three small almost hairless dogs came trotting into the room. They all looked exactly alike. They sniffed at her and then left the room, moving almost in formation. She thought she saw something on the back of the head of each dog, some kind of patch in their hair.

****

"Yes, water would be fine."

****

He went into the kitchen and returned with a still sealed plastic bottle. It was cold. He set it on the low table in front of the couch. After sitting in his chair, he said, "Tell me about yourself."

****

She twisted the cap off and took a drink. "I'm twenty-eight. I have a degree in comparative literature from State U. I'm trying to make a living as a writer but the market for my work seems to have dried up. I'm living off my savings, my family gives me a little money, and I sometimes look for work on the web. That's why I'm here. I'm not a professional model but I keep in shape and have a nice complexion. What is it you are looking for?"

****

"Have you ever modeled before?"

****

"I did for a semester in college. A class for freshmen art appreciation. That was over a decade ago, though."

****

"So you didn't mind being nude in front of strangers?"

****

"Well, it was a paying job. As long as I avoided eye contact it wasn't too bad. The only problem I remember was it would get chilly in the winter and I would get goosebumps in all the wrong places."

****

He showed a hint of a smiled.

****

"Are you a photographer or painter?"

****

He looked at her for a moment, looked at her thoughtfully, and said, "Neither. But I do need you to model for me. I am . . . a kind of sculptor. Do you think you could do that?"

****

"I mean no disrespect but I do have some reservations being so far out here alone. I would need to do a background check on you first to be sure you are legitimate. I let my friends know where I was going today." She was looking at her hands on her lap as she said this. She paused for a couple of seconds, looked up at him and continued, " You don't have any criminal record, do you?"

****

"No, I'm just an old retired professor. My days of chasing pretty young things like you are long gone. In fact it stopped when I met the last pretty young thing I happened to chase, my wife." She smiled at him, warming to his humor..

****

"If I accept this job, how long will it last and how much will I receive?"

****

"Oh, a few afternoons should do, and I'll pay you enough to pay your rent for a year."

****

Shocked, she said, "Really? You have that kind of money?"

****

"Yes. I have several patents that still pay me quite well and I have sufficient funds to take care of your fee. You might think me poor living in this old house but that is not the case. My children tried to get me to move to a more civilized place after their mother died but I am comfortable here. Comfortable."

****

"Oh, you have children?"

****

A far away look came over his eyes. "No, they died in the Quake of 2040\. If I had moved out there, I probably would be gone, too." He stared at the wall where a small family portrait hung.

****

"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked."

****

"That's alright. You had no way of knowing."

****

They sat quietly for a few moments. She took another sip of water from the bottle.

****

"How soon can I start? I only ask because my rent is due and if I apply for Robo Security it will still take weeks before I get even that meager amount."

****

"Tell you what. I will give you one month's rent in advance, today. I would like to take a few photos of you and if I decide you are the one I want and I'll let you know next week. Would that be ok?"

****

"If you don't decide to use me, do I have to give the money back?"

****

"No, that will be your fee for letting me take a few pictures of you with your clothes on -- and off."

****

He flashed a brief smile and she thought she detected a twinkle in his eye. She was starting to like this old codger, even if she didn't fully trust him, at least not yet.

****

"Also, I need to know if you can hold your breathe for a full sixty seconds."

****

"Well, I used to swim at the Y until my funds dried up and sometimes I swam the length of the pool under water. Can we give it a try?" He nodded his head. She took a few deep breathes and held it. The old fashioned clock on the wall had a sweep second hand and an analog face. At fifty seconds she gave up and gasped for air.

****

"That's not too bad for a first try. When you get home, spend some time building up your endurance. You should be able to get sixty seconds with a little practice."

****

She nodded her head and continued catching her breath..

****

"If it's ok with you, let's go out into my back yard and we will take the photos I need to make my decision."

****

He led her through another hallway and out into the rear yard. What she saw amazed her. In contrast to the unkempt front yard, this had the look of a manicured landscape that went on for fifty yards, covering the ground where another house had once stood on the next street. Surrounding the yard was a seven foot hedge that was at least ten feet wide at the top. Trees and fountains, flowerbeds and winding gravel paths meandered over the ground. 

****

"You have a beautiful place. Who does all the gardening?"

****

Before he answered she noticed the robo gardener at the far end of the property, trimming the hedge on its extended skinny legs.

****

"Oh, I should have guessed. Who designed this? It looks wonderful."

****

"My oldest daughter was a horticulturist and she did most of the layout. My son did most of the programming on the 'Bot. They both did a wonderful job. This was my retirement present from them. Their mother enjoyed it for several years. Come, I want to show you something really wonderful.

****

She followed him on a winding path. He moved slowly but steadily. Soon she heard the sound of falling water and as they turned a corner a hidden alcove came into view. A waterfall ten feet tall cascaded down a stone wall and into a pool covered with large water lilies, some sporting pink, white or purple flowers.. She glimpsed flashes of color from large multi-hued fish, some a foot long. In the center of the pond stood the white statue of a young woman, draped in a clinging dress, one hand akimbo and the other holding a hat behind her. Her face was turned to one side and had a Mona Lisa smile.

****

He sat on a bench and indicated the spot next to him for her to sit. The bench was situated so that the statue seemed to be looking directly at them. A koi surfaced to catch an insect. A frog jumped into the water. Birds could be heard singing in the nearby trees.

****

"My wife, several years before she died."

****

""I thought you said your wife was playing the piano."

****

"Oh, she was. It's a 

Bösendorfer

player piano and I have many recordings of her playing it."

****

Charisse sat without saying anything. She noticed hairline cracks in several places on the white surface. It was a beautiful statue in a beautiful setting.

****

"That's a wonderful statue. Did you carve it yourself?"

****

"Yes, and no. I used an invention I made, a kind of pantograph that copies real objects. It made the rough copy and then I applied the finishing touches by hand." He paused for a few seconds. "You may notice there are cracks in the marble."

****

She nodded yes.

****

He didn't see her nod but continued. "A few months after my wife died I entered a deep depression. I bought a sledgehammer and smashed the statue and left it buried in the pond. I could not bear to see it there while Miranda was dead and buried in the ground. Her grave is over there in the pine grove." He pointed off to the right when a stand of ten or fifteen tall pine trees stood in the corner of the property.

****

"I went through a dark period. I turned off the garden bot. This place grew wild. The fish all but died. I didn't cut my hair, cut my nails or go out in public for months. I lost a hundred pounds. I was skin and bones. My children threatened to institutionalize me if I didn't get some help. After enough time had past, I cleaned myself up and I did seek grief counseling. One of the things my doctor said would help was to rescue the statue and put it back together. There you see the result."

****

She saw him gazing up at the eyes of the statue as it gazed back at him. A warm glow came over her as she realized here was a case of true love and true tragedy. She put her hand on his, left it there a moment and took it back. He made no response

****

"What happened to Miranda, your wife?"

****

"She had a rare form of early-onset Alzheimer's. She had an augmentation chip installed in her skull and lived a normal healthy life for quite some time. But the disease finally took her from me."

****

"Augmentation chip?"

****

"That's right, Alzheimer's is now an almost forgotten condition so you wouldn't know. Back then the doctors could put a zettabyte memory chip in the hippocampus and that would take over some of the functions of the brain which had been damaged by the disease. Miranda lived a comfortable life with that device in her head. She never let it bother her too much."

****

He grew quiet and Charisse didn't want to break the contemplative mood which had set in. What had started out as a sunny morning was turning into a cloudy day. She glanced at her Watch and saw rain was still forecast in a couple of hours. She still had no signal. She needed to start on her trip home.

****

"So, you are thinking about sculpting again? That's why you need someone to model for you?"

****

"Something like that." He grew quiet again.

****

"Well, I should be getting back. Can we take the photos you said you needed?"

****

"Right. Let's go back to the house. First, though, stand there by the pond and mimic the pose of the statue."

****

She walked the few feet to the pool's rim, studied the statue for a moment, and then struck a pose.

****

"Perfect," he said. He took out an ancient camera and pointed the lens at her. She heard an old fashioned camera click as the electronics captured her image. "You look almost like her. You could pass for sisters."

****

They walked side by side on the wide path. She could see why the old man had wanted to stay in his home, even though he was far from civilization and neighbors.

****

"How do you get around? Do you still drive? I didn't see any buses or urban transports on my ride out here. In fact I didn't see anyone for the last three or four miles."

****

"No, if I need to go somewhere, I call Ueber Alles and they send a robocar. Everything else can be dropped by drone here in my backyard. See that circle over there? That's my drone landing pad." He pointed out a ten foot circle of short grass painted with white chalk, making a kind of bull's eye from the sky. "I rarely leave home. I have everything I need here." The solar panels on the roof of the house flashed for a second as they moved along.

****

"You don't worry about home invaders? I hear they are a problem in the warrens." She had a neighbor who had been attacked awhile back.

****

"You don't see it but there are security measures around. If you had tried to enter the property anyplace else but the front door, you wouldn't be here now. If you tried to batter down my door or enter through a front window, you would be in a pit beneath the porch, awaiting the county sheriff or his deputy. No, I'm fine here by myself. Plus I have my three chihuahuas to keep me company."

****

""I thought I saw a cat sleeping in the sitting room."

****

"Oh, that's Elisa. She's been like that for years. When she died of old age I had her freeze dried. It's a type of preservation that works well for pets. I even considered it for Miranda but the children said no. It was illegal to that to a human body. I've had to be satisfied until now with the statue."

****

They entered a studio in the garage, crowded with equipment, wires, contraptions she didn't recognize. The only thing she thought was familiar was a tank with a door, about the size of a small hot tub. It looked like something from a movie she remembered about sensory deprivation. 

Altered States

with a young William Hurt.

****

In the corner was a curved white wall with a wooden round platform an inch above the floor. Next to it was a strange type of camera with a foot wide back. It stood on a tripod. He turned on a bank of lights and the lit up the corner.

****

"OK. If you are ready, you can disrobe and go stand on the round platform. When we are ready I will push a button, you will rotate around a couple of times in about thirty seconds, and I will take a series of photos of you. Will that be all right?"

****

"Yes. So we will be done in a couple of minutes? It might rain before I get home today."

****

"You'll be on your way in five minutes or less."

****

She walked off to the side where a table sat. She took off her top, her bra, her shoes and pants, and finally her underwear. She had her back to him all this time. When she turned around she saw he wasn't even watching her but was working on the camera. She walked over to the turntable on the floor, stepped on it and stood facing him. He finally noticed her.

****

"Good. Now stand with your arms straight out. And you will need to keep your eyes tightly closed until I say open. You'll see and perhaps feel a series of flashes of light on your skin. Oh, you'll need to remove any jewelry or metal. Hand me your Watch." She took it off and handed it to him. She noticed him trying not to look at her. So far he had been a perfect gentleman..

****

"Also, I noticed you wear contacts. It is important you keep your eyes tightly shut during this process. I am not only photographing you, I am scanning and measuring your surface metabolism. There will be some noise but not too much. And you may feel the slightest touch of sunburn afterwards, but it is very safe. Are you ready?"

****

She held her arms straight out, shut her eyes, and said,"I'm ready." She felt like giggling but stifled the urge. He was so serious about this.

****

"Here we go, then."

****

A low hum like a transformer warming up began. She felt the turntable slowly rotate, slow enough she didn't have to worry about losing her balance. She felt and saw through her closed eyelids pulses of light, getting brighter then dimmer, synchronized with popping sounds. It began to get warm. She held her breath, trying to stay absolutely still. Finally the rotating came to an end. It grew quiet.

****

"OK, you may get dressed." She opened her eyes and saw he was removing from his head something like a welder's mask with dark lenses where the eyes would be. He moved toward her to help her down. Stepping off the turntable she stumble and he caught her in his arms, his mask just touching her left breast. It was warm to the touch. Hiding her embarrassment, she quickly got dressed while he turned off his equipment and put things away. 

****

As she dressed she noticed the fine hairs on her arms and legs had turned to fine ash and fell away. Her skin felt warm and sensitive to the touch but that quickly went away. Fully dressed, she turned to him and asked, "So, how did it go?"

****

"Very well. You did just fine. Let's get you your money so you can get on the road. 

****

He led her from the garage back to the house. Once inside he said, "First, drink this. You'll find you may be a bit dehydrated." He handed her the unfinished water bottle he'd brought her when she first arrived. She drank, and did feel a bit better.

****

He went to a panel on the wall in the sitting room and opened a small safe. "Is five thousand about right?"

****

He gave her a stack of fifty crisp old fashioned paper bills with Benjamin Franklin on the front. She'd have to fill out a form to get these deposited but they were still legal tender. This would pay her rent and and she could treat herself to a couple of nights out with the money he gave her. 

****

"I need some contact information." He handed her a small pocket Pad and she touched it to her Watch. Now he had her phone number and addresses. "I will give you a call in a few days if I decide to use you."

****

He walked her to the open front door, gave her a slight smile, shook her hand. She turned, stepped out onto the porch and the door closed. Three locks clunked into place.

****

She put the paper money in an inside pocket of her jacket and zipped it shut. She was on her bike and down the road in a minute, strangely hoping to see this old guy again, sometime soon. Storm clouds were on the horizon and dusk was falling.

****

Part 2

****

Charisse's rent was paid. She had found a short gig writing advertising jingles for an on-line store. She was set for a few months more. Perhaps she could now finish her novel and get it on line before the robowriters took over the entire literary world. She had found a niche site that accepted works from only corporeal writers. They had a readership who appreciated her kind of writing. She had all but forgotten about the sculptor in the woods. But she had worked on her breathing and could hold it for almost ninety seconds. It came in handy now going up and down the stairs -- she no longer had to endure the stink the robocleaners had been unable to remove. Smelled like something had died out there.

****

She had a message on her Phone about a package for her at the front desk. She hiked down the exterior stairway, made her way to the small area which passed as a lobby and punched in her code to open the parcel box. There wasn't a package. Just a thin white envelope. She hadn't gotten a letter since her grandmother had sent her a birthday card with a hundred dollar bill twenty years ago. She recognized the return address. Deciding to wait on opening it, she took it back to her room.

****

Sitting at her desk, she opened the letter. The bright sunlight highlighted the clear penmanship of the hand written letter:

****

"Dear Clarisse,

****

Thank you for applying for the modeling position. I have decided to use your services for my project.

****

I need you to come to my home next week.. October 31 to be exact. 9 AM.

Plan to spend the night. You should be finished in time to be home the next evening.

****

I hope you have been practicing your breath holding technique. You MUST be able to hold your breathe at least sixty seconds, as we discussed during your last visit.

****

Also, we will need to shave your head. I hope you agree with that proviso.

****

As we agreed, your fee will be $60,000\. I will be able to directly transfer that amount to your account when we are finished.

****

Sincerely

****

Proff. K. Brian Schwegman, ret.

****

She couldn't make out the signature at the bottom of the page. It could be the name of the man she had done an intensive background check on the Net. She'd even paid the fee for premium information. He was who he said he was. A professor emeritus at State U., but he had not been in the Arts department. He had been in bioengineering research. Perhaps sculpting was a hobby. No outstanding warrants. No living relatives. And she noticed he had gotten her first name wrong. Perhaps he was going senile in his old age. He was almost a hundred years old.

****

She looked at the postmark on the old-fashioned stamp on the envelope. She wondered if they did that by hand or if a machine still did that. The stamp was a commemorative "forever" stamp, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the first manned moon landing. That made the stamp over thirty years old. It had been mailed two weeks ago and had arrived today, October 29\. It must have traveled halfway around the world and back again, just to go ten miles. But at least it had arrived in time. She didn't know why he didn't use email or text. She hadn't received a voice call for months but that would have worked just as well. Then she remembered her Phone didn't have a signal when she was on his porch. He must live in a null zone. How does one live without Phone service? That far from civilization probably meant he had no wired Internet. There was still satellite signals he could pick up. Perhaps he liked living off the grid. No, he had to have had some type of service to put his advertisement on the web. But she knew she would have no signal for her phone. She would have to borrow or rent an inReach communications unit. If she could see the sky, the Iridium satellite system would pick up her text signal. She had used one a while back when she was backpacking in Denali Park in Alaska. Or perhaps she would not need to contact anyone for a couple of days.

****

As for shaving her head, she had considered doing that herself a while back when it was so popular. But the fad had passed and you didn't see that much anymore. But it wouldn't be a problem if he still planned to pay her what he had promised. She could just buy a wig. She could buy a couple of wigs, if she wanted to.
