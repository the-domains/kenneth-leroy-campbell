**No, the photo is not of me. But don't you sometimes feel like screaming at the stupidity and selfishness of those around you? There is a scene in Luc Bresson's film  _The Fifth Element_ where the reconstituted "Supreme Being" is catching up on Her history lessons since she was out of touch for several thousand years. When She comes across a lesson about war and the 20th century, She is aghast at what mankind has been up to. She despairs that there is no hope, no reason for even trying to save mankind. The only thing that saves us is that the Bruce Willis character finally convinces Her that love exists and that that is enough to make amends for some of the awful things we do to each other.**
