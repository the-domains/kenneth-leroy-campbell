Have you ever wanted to scream about all the stupidity you see about you?

Sometimes one wants to crawl back into the cave and say "Good try, humanity. Better luck next time." For every step forward there is always a little jog back.  I suppose all we can do is to contribute the little we can to progress and hope we all survive to face a better future.

In Luc Bresson's film The Fifth Element, there is a scene where the reconstituted Supreme Being (She's been asleep for thousands of years and only a scrap of Her survived total destruction) is reviewing human history on a computer screen. When she comes across the visuals of the 20th century and all the wars mankind has been involved in, She is aghast! She laments that there is no reason to make any effort to save mankind from the impending doom heading towards Earth if this is what mankind has evolved into. Only the efforts of Bruce Willis's character convinces her that there is one reason --  love. If love did not exist, then all would be lost.
